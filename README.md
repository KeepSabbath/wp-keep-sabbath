# Keep Sabbath: Wordpress plugin

A WordPress plugin to help you observe the Biblical Sabbath and Holy days by automatically redirecting specific pages of your site on those days. Keep Sabbath is available in the Wordpress.org plugin directory [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/keep-sabbath/).


## About this Initiative

Keep Sabbath is a plugin to help those that want to keep the 7th-day Sabbath and Biblical Holy days set-apart (holy) by not buying or selling on them. (Genesis 2:2,3 ; Isaiah 58:13,14 ; Amos 8:5 ; Nehemiah 10: 31 ; Jeremiah 17:21,22 ; Matthew 6:33 ; Acts 16:13)

You can input specific page URLs to redirect to a certain page URL during the Sabbath and/or specified Holy days. This is useful for e-commerce sites or any site that has online purchasing. It will automatically start redirecting when the Sabbath or Holy days begin, and stop re-directing afterwards.

The timing is based on the understanding that Biblical days begin at sunset and end at sunset the following day.

* For the 7th-day Sabbath, this means from sundown Fri. to sundown Sat. it will automatically redirect with no extra configuration from you. 
* For Biblical holy days (Passover, Pentacost, etc) this means that the day will start sundown the day prior to the day you specify in the admin Holy Day Dates setting.


## Note

*I believe we should keep the Sabbath out of love for our Father in Heaven (John 14:15), but I do not condemn anyone that holds a different understanding than I do on the Sabbath. It's a wonderful gift He has given us every seventh-day to relax and spend time focusing on Him. Not a burden at all. Quite the opposite. :) If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at hi@noahrahm.com*


## Privacy

The plugin uses on-server calculations rather than an api to determine the sunset times. Therefore, no data is shared with any third-party whatsoever. Everything this plugin uses and does is on the server and does not require any external services. All that to say: this is as privacy-friendly as you can get.
